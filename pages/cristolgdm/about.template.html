	<h3>About this website</h3>

	<p>This website was done "manually". I wanted to try to have a functional website while using as little external packages. As such, while it uses AngularJS and ui-router, it doesn't use any other framework, any package, doesn't have any dependency <i>(edit: I ended up using <a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">prism</a> for code previews, as my own implementation was taking way too much of my time)</i>. Everything was written by hand.</p>
	
	<p>Same for the CSS: I strongly believe that a website can be good looking AND functional AND fast, without relying on themes or frameworks, and while keeping everything as simple as possible. So again, everything was written by hand. I tried to keep it minimal, but I guess some animations sneaked in.</p>

	<p>I hope the experience was comfortable; this is obviously not a big project, but if you're interested you can follow it <a href="https://gitlab.com/Mikalichov/homepage" target="_blank">here</a>. Any advice or feedback is more than welcome!</p>

	<p>One more thing: if everything went right, you are currently in a Proxmox VM in a micro-computer in my living room, after being redirected by a whole chain of AWS + pfSense + reverse proxy + dynamic DNS etc. It's not much, but considering how long it took me to make it work I wanted to mention it.</p>

	<h3>About me</h3>

	<p>I'm just a small-time developer in a big-time company. I enjoy a lot of things, but for some reason it often brings me back to computers. I don't really expect many people to come here, and even less to come back, but if you do you might see me write about programming, life, video and tabletop games, and lego. Maybe movies.</p>

<div class="article-content" style="padding: 60px 0">
	<p>This website was done "manually".</p>

	<p>I wanted to prove that it was possible to have a functional website without relying on external packages. As such, while it uses AngularJS and ui-router, it doesn't use any other framework, any package, doesn't have any dependency. Everything was written by hand.</p>

	<p>Same for the CSS: I strongly believe that a website can be good looking AND fucntional AND fast, without relying on themes or frameworks, and while keeping everything as simple as possible. So again, everything was written by hand.</p>

	<p>This is obviously not a big project, but if you're interested you can follow it <a href="https://github.com/CristolGDM/homepage" target="_blank">here</a>. Any advice or feedback is more than welcome!</p>

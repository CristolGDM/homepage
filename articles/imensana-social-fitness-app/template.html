		<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
		<p>The objective for this project was to create a high-fidelity mockup design of a fitness app intended for tablet supports. The app would try to find a new niche to occupy in the already busy fitness apps market.</p>

		<h2>METHOD</h2>
		<p><b>State of the art review:</b> I searched the most popular fitness apps, and what were their specificities. I also checked what most “trendy” elements they had.I found two recurring themes: custom content creation, and social sharing.</p>

		<p>Custom content creation was very prominent, mirroring a similar trend in other apps or services (Twitch, YouTube, LPC). One such example in a fitness app is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitnessbuilder/id306287984?mt=8" target="_blank">Fitness Builder</a>:</p>

		<p>Social sharing was even more prominent, as expected considering the current state of the digital market. An example of a fitness app featuring social sharing is <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/" target="_blank">Fitocracy</a>:</p>

		<p><b>Interviews:</b> This was followed by user interviews, following a prepared script, in local gym clubs and on fitness forums online. Users expressed interest in creating their own content, and also mentioned achievements. Several of them (19 out of 32) mentioned wanting more variety than just the usual “running and lifting stuff”.</p>

		<h2>RESULTS</h2>
		<p>A prototype was made through Photoshop, and shown to a group of 32 users separately. Questionnaires were given to the users in order to assess their opinion of the interface.</p>

		<p>Overall, feedback was positive. 62.5% of the users were interested in using the app if it was available. The social interaction functionality was seen as positive (90.6%).</p>

		<p>However, the interface as is was considered a bit too cluttered (15.6% thought the app displayed a correct amount of information).</p>

		<p>On a more qualitative side, users were enthusiastic to create their own programs, but they had some worries about the app not being available on phones.</p>

    <p>Like the title says I've been playing the same character since release, and last night I finally finished the game (as in, I beat Alduin, still plenty to do). I'm not sure that's interesting to anybody, but that was a big experience for me so I hope you'll indulge me.</p>

    <p>First, some numbers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>My current play time is at 517 hours since leaving Helgen</li>
      <li>I played 617 hours according to Steam (but played the first 6 months on a pirated version, see below)</li>
      <li>Calendar is Frostfall 4E202, so about 1 year and a half since Helgen, which isn't that much all considered</li>
      <li>I'm level 109</li>
      <li>Legendary'd all skills at least once:

    <p>So... yeah. It's been a long adventure. I started my character as a broke grad student, quasi-homeless, on a crappy laptop using a pirated version (sorry; I bought the game several times since then if that helps). Fast forward 11 years and I'm married, have kids, a stable job, I live on the other side of the world, my hair is greying, and the one constant for that whole time was that install of Skyrim I've been carrying from laptop to computer to computer, from country to country, from home to home.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to pretend this is my favorite game and I keep playing every day, but for some reason I just keep going back to it year after year. I like having that virtual world always available on my computer, and I love immersing myself every couple months in what is, at this point, almost another life.</p>

    <p>Not sure where to go from there, to be honest. I feel a bit empty. I still have much much more to do so I'll definitely come back to it at some point. At this rate I should probably start Dragonborn soon, if I want to finish before TES6 comes out :)</p>

    <p>Anyway thanks for reading, thanks everyone at Bethesda who worked on making such a great game, and thanks to all modders who made it even better</p>

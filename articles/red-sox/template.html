		<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>

		<p>Fenway Park is Boston’s historical baseball park, and has a strong history and personality. The objective for this project was to create a working high-def prototype for a Fenway companion app. The app would accompany supporters, help them buy food and drinks, and give them incentive to come back for later games.</p>

		<h2>RESEARCH</h2>

		<p>I am absolutely not into baseball, and I don’t know anything about it. So I had to learn. First, I went directly to Fenway park. There, I tried to do two things:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Get an idea about what kind of people go to baseball games, and so would be potential users for our app.</li>
			<li>Find out what baseball fans like, and their design sensibilities</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It seemed that baseball was attended by people of all age, but mostly people would go as families. People were very insistent about baseball being a familial tradition: baseball had been part of their family for a long time, they went with their parents when they were young, were now taking their own children, and were confident those children would do the same later.</p>

		<h2>DESIGN</h2>

		<p>I chose PhotoShop for this prototype, as it is a tool I felt comfortable with.</p>

		<p>I went for a realistic, kind of skeumorphic, feel (skeuomorphism was big in 2010). Several objects mentioned by fans as important during research (tickets, score sheets, etc) were used as buttons or displays in the app. The objective for this was to increase users’ “attachment” to the app.</p>

		<p>Top tabs were made to look like generic sport tickets.</p>

		<p>On the left side, Fenway park tickets synced with the users tickets when providing a ticket number, and displayed useful information such as seating, and position on the map.</p>

		<h2>TESTING</h2>

		<p>For testing, the various screens were linked together through PowerPoint. The result was shown to participants in Fenway park, in two occasions: during the day, to Fenway visitors who were Boston residents, and to supporters right before a game.</p>

		<p>Users were presented with the Powerpoint prototype running on an Android tablet. They were asked to complete several tasks:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Check the score (ceiling task, very easy task intended to make the users comfortable with the process. Results are not included below)</li>
			<li>Order food from one of the fictional stores</li>
			<li>Find news regarding a specific player</li>
			<li>Find when was the next game against the Giants.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>RESULTS</h2>

		<p>On the quantitative side, we had the following results:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>100% of users managed to order food (x̄.clicks = 3.1, x̄.time = 17s). Users had some issue finding the first correct step from home menu, but the process went smoothly afterwards</li>
			<li>100% of users managed to find news regarding a specific player (x̄.clicks = 5.5, x̄.time = 20.1s). Users found the results pretty consistently and with no hesitation; however, they mentioned reaching the result took a bit too much time.</li>
			<li>100% of users managed to find when the next game against the Giants was (x̄.clicks = 3, x̄.time = 8s). No specific issues.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>On a more qualitative side, several users said they liked the “feel” and personality of the app, while some of them mention it being a bit overbearing.</p>

		<p>I am currently running a Shadowrun campaign on PbP, and I have made the worst mistake. The characters being part of the army, they received a mission briefing ending with: “the mission will start next week, you have 7 days to make your preparations”.</p>

		<p>That was four months ago. Two days have passed in game.</p>

		<p>The characters have spent a crazy amount of time exploring the Matrix, the Astral, asking their contacts, adjusting and re-adjusting and re-re-adjusting their loadout.</p>

		<p>And it doesn't even mean they're bad players! It's a logical behavior based on their situation: they want to be ready, they have virtually infinite time to get ready (outside the game), they're spending as much time as possible getting ready. Like Soren Johnson famously said in <a href="https://www.designer-notes.com/?p=369" target="_blank">this article</a>:</p>

		<blockquote>"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."</blockquote>

		<p>At first I figured I would remove preparation completely for their next mission. But then, it would remove some of Shadowrun’s fun, right? And then, I remembered Leverage RPG.</p>

		<h3>Behold: THE SHADOWRUN OVER-PREPARATION FIX.</h3>
		<em>(warning: can also make the game a lot cooler)</em>

		<p>At any time, a character can spend an Edge point to call a flashback. The player describes the action and makes an appropriate roll if necessary. It happens, no matter the roll's result. If the roll is failed however, the situation might go bad in some other direction. The flashback has to be called by another character, whether a PC or NPC – this can be described by the player as he wants.</p>

		<hr />

		<h3>Example:</h3> 

		<p>The group infiltrated the office where they are supposed to steal a chip. While the gunslinger covers the entrance, the others realize that the chip is an absurdly efficient safe, and they have no hope of opening it. Raven, the ex-ganger street samurai, reaches for the door with a confident look on her face.</p>

		<p><b>Zhen, adept:</b> “Wait, you think you can unlock that thing?” <em>(this is the call)</em></p>

		<p><b>Raven:</b> “Better than that…” <em>(spends an edge point)</em></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>One day earlier. A man is running in the rainy streets of Hong-Kong, holding his bag against his chest. He keeps glancing above his shoulder. Bumps into someone. Let out a yelp. Realizes it's only a street sweeper. Reassured, he grumbles some insults and walks away.</p>

			<p>No one notices the cleaner dropping something in her jacket as she disappears in a dark alley. <em>(The player makes a Palming roll here)</em></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>The samurai gets a magnetic key out of her pocket, a huge grin on her face.</p>

		<p><b>Raven:</b> "People drop all kind of things, don’t you think?"</p>

		<hr />

		<p>If her Palming roll succeeded, this is indeed the correct key, and the chip is inside the safe. If it failed, it is <strong>still</strong> the correct key… but maybe the chip is not inside? It is filled with drones? It is linked to the building alarm system? All of the above?</p>

		<p>So here you have it! This has helped give a better capre "feel" to our game, and I hope it does the same with yours.</p>

		<p><i><b>Edit:</b> since then I have read Blades in the Dark which has <strong>wonderful</strong> advice for running a caper game, and which would definitely work with Shadowrun.</i></p>

		<p><i>The part about assuming the PCs plan work perfectly until it doesn't, and to start the game <strong>only</strong> at the point where it starts going wrong is especially relevant: it makes players feel like their plan was worth it, skips all the boring parts, starts in media res, etc.</i></p>

		<p><i>Definitely a recommended read if you want to add some caper to your shadows.</i></p>

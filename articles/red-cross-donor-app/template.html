		<p>Another project done for a teaching course by <a href="https://www.emergobyul.com/services/human-factors-research-design/" target="_blank">Wiklund & Kendler</a>. The assignment was to design a tablet app for Red Cross’ Blood Drives. Potential blood donors are usually oriented by nurses. Having an alternate way to orient new arrivals would allow nurses to focus on blood donations or other medical issues. The Red Cross has tried paper questionnaires in the past, but is considering switching to a more digital format. The idea for this project is to give a tablet to potential blood donors on arrival. The app would help the user go through orientation, determine whether he is eligible to donate blood or not, and answer his questions. Other features could be added if deemed necessary. This project would go only up to wireframing.</p>

		<p>Based on that simple description, I had our users (blood donors) and our tasks (go through orientation, determine eligibility). I could move to research.</p>

		<h2>FIRST STEP: RESEARCH</h2>

		<p>As always, even with this kind of description it is necessary to do research. <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/" target="_blank">The Red Cross Blood donations website</a> gave me good hints about what graphic chart to adopt, and most of the app content.</p>

		<p>I then went on to meet users. Harvard University was hosting a blood donation, which was perfect, so I went there directly. I talked with some donors, asked about their expectations and needs. I also talked with some of the nurses there. Even though they were not listed as users, they were probably going to interact with the app too and were familiar with the actual donation flow.</p>

		<h2>SECOND STEP: PLANIFICATION</h2>

		<p>Based on this first research, I made some personas and a conceptual model of the required features. Personas were made for the most common kinds donors I had met. I didn’t build personas for nurses, as they were not “official” users of our app.</p>

		<h3>Second step, first part: Personas</h3>

				<h4>BRUCE BARCH – 54 YEARS OLD – MECHANIC</h4>

				Bruce is a regular blood donor. He started a few years ago and since then has donated blood every couple of months. Some years ago, his wife actually suffered from leukemia and was helped by the mobilisation of several donors who wanted to help Bruce. Since then, he is even more dedicated to donating blood. He considers it an important part of his life and is ready to help in any way he can.

				<h4>SARAH PORTER – 22 YEARS OLD – STUDENT</h4>

				Sarah is a psychology student. She has heard a lot of her friends talk about donating blood and decided she was going to donate too. She has never donated blood before, but intends on doing it for the first time this year. She is motivated, but is scared of needles. She was not able to come with her friends as she planned too, so she has a lots of questions about the donation process.

				<h4>CAMERON WILLIAMS – 27 YEARS OLD – UNEMPLOYED</h4>

				Cameron is actually not really sure why she is coming to the blood donation center. She donated blood a few years ago, but is worried she might get rejected this time, as she had several risky behaviors in the last years. She actually hopes that if she is rejected she could be oriented, and be able to know if she is alright or not. She is also willing to volunteer if the possibility arises.

		<h3>Second step, second part: Conceptual Model</h3>

		<p>Important tasks were listed and grouped together based on common themes. Our three biggest groupings were “Donating Blood” “Help” “Social”.</p>

		<h3>Second step, third part: UI Structure</h3>

		<p>Those different tasks were then arranged into a coherent structure. This was based on our groupings, on the Red Cross website, with a teaspoon of intuition.</p>

		<h2>THIRD STEP: FIRST MOCKUP.</h2>

		<p>The reason I like planning is that it makes the final work so much easier. I had my content, my structure, my graphic chart, and making the first mockups was almost a breeze. Almost.</p>

		<p>I actually got carried away and made them a bit higher fidelity than I had originally planned to. I used Photoshop to design all elements. The theme was mostly white and red, to follow the Red Cross brand. The tones of red used by the Red Cross ended being a bit overwhelming on a tablet, and so it was darkened a bit for this project.</p>

		<h2>FOURTH STEP: USER TESTING</h2>

		<p>With those mockups in hand, I went back to the Red Cross donation and showed it to people there.</p>

		<p>From a design point of view, users mentioned not recognizing if the circles were buttons or not, and often hesitated tapping them. I considered at first leaving them as is and that the users would learn, but that would be bad UX. Best practice would be to make them recognizable as buttons. Similarly, questionnaire buttons were too difficult to use, and text was too small all over the board.</p>

		<p>From a usability point of view, I realized that I hadn’t considered the relative importance of each option. For example, yes, a blood donor can do four types of donation. But <b>blood</b> donation is the most common. Shouldn’t more important options, or options most likely to be chosen, be presented on the same scale as obscure or infrequent ones?</p>

		<p>This was a reminder that <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/385981879/you-are-not-your-user" target="_blank">I am not my users</a>. My research was not complete: I had talked with users, researched the process, observed the process, but I had not <b>done</b> the process. This should have been an obvious step from the start, but I had never donated blood before and to be honest, I was quite scared. But being more stubborn than scared, a couple days later I had a needle in my arm, a pint of blood slowly drifting away. For science!</p>

		<p>This gave me a better insight into the actual blood donation process, what donors go through, what they need, what they don’t, and what they <b>could</b> need. And hopefully it helped someone out there: a win-win situation, indeed.</p>

		<h2>FIFTH STEP: WIREFRAME</h2>

		<p>With this in mind, I went back to planning. The UI underlying structure didn’t need to change too much, but I changed how options were displayed, putting more emphasis on more important options. Questionnaire buttons were made bigger, and text size was increased all over the app. Once these modifications were done, a wireframe was put together through Axure.</p>

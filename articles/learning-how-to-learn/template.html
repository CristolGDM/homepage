		<p>For most of my life I've been lucky enough to try a lot of different things, work in a lot of different fields, and live in a lot of different countries. This means that I also had to learn a lot of things pretty fast.</p>

		<p>What I found in those situations was that the best way to learn how to do something was based on three pillars:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>observation (how other people are doing the thing, or studying the finished thing)</li>

			<li>theory (learning about how the thing works, how the thing is supposed to be done)</li>

			<li>practice (actually doing the thing)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>None of those are new, obviously, but in my experience they're often applied separately. School focuses mostly on theory, sport training focus mostly on practice, etc. This is <i>fine</i>, but I strongly believe that those three all build on each other and will get you much better results when used together:</p>

		<p>While observing someone, theory helps you understand what you're seeing, and you see solutions for issues you encountered during your own practice.</p>

		<p>While learning some theory, you can remember seeing people apply that theory (or fail to) and the results it produced, and you can recognize some of the issues you encountered while practicing.</p>

		<p>And finally, while practicing you benefit from having seen someone do the thing already, and from having some theoretical knowledge about the thing. Also you're actually doing the thing you're trying to do, which is nice.</p>

		<p>When you think about it this is how babies learn to speak, to walk, to eat, etc. They look at how their parents and teachers do things, they learn about it in school, and mostly they try to do it themselves.</p>

		<p>Some examples:</p>

		<h4>Learning a language</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> listening to other people having a conversation</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> learning the grammar, vocabulary</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> having a conversation with someone</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Becoming better at programming</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> watching YouTube videos, doing pair programming</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> reading books, articles about specific paradigms</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> actually coding</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Learning a new framework</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> watching videos, reading source code of open-source projects</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> reading the documentation</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> actually coding</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Learning how to draw</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> analyzing drawings of the type you're interested in</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> reading a "how to draw book"</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> actually drawing</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Learning to play the piano</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> have someone else play the piano in front of you</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> reading theory about finger positioning, scales</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> actually playing the piano</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Learning how to make games</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> analyzing games you're playing</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> reading articles and books about game architecture and game design</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> actually making games</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Learning how to learn</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Observation:</b> looking at how other people successfully (or not) learn something</li>
			<li><b>Theory:</b> reading cognitive psychology studies about memory and learning, reading this article</li>
			<li><b>Practice:</b> trying to learn something new</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Obviously this is mostly my opinion, and there is way more to it, but I encourage you to give it a shot.</p>

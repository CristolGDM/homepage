		<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>This one is quite special. I was hired to redesign a website, whose main activity is media galleries, and that gets its profit through ads and partnerships.</p>

			<p>I was given full control of the site’s servers, statistics, and full power to change and modify anything I wanted. This was my first project with so much responsibilities, and it was amazing.</p>

			<p>My objectives were to redo the site’s design. It had been developed with functionality only in mind, and it was starting to be an issue. I had to fix all the usability issues, improve the SEO, and basically make it as good as I could.</p>

			<p>One detail that I was hiding until now (on purpose): it was an adult website distributing fan-made adult material based on Japanese video games and TV series. Therefore, most of the screenshots below have been edited to hide as much NSFW stuff as possible.</p>

			<p>I considered keeping it secret for a long time, but it is honestly one of the projects I am the proudest of, and from what I can tell there is close to no research on UX for this kind of websites (with the exception of the <a href="https://blog.eat24.com/how-to-advertise-on-a-porn-website/">amazing Eat24’s ad reports</a>) so here it is.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>RESEARCH</h2>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>I first used <a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/guidelines.html">standard heuristics</a> to determine the biggest issues:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>There was no home link on most pages.</li>
				<li>There was no implemented search engine.</li>
				<li>The navigation menu wasn’t present on all pages.</li>
				<li>There was no logic in how categories were displayed, no present hierarchy.</li>
				<li>Tags were very well implemented, but located at the very bottom of each page, and not visible by most users.</li>
				<li>As a minor but important point, the site’s color theme (blue tones) wasn’t fitting this kind of site or the behavior you want your users to have.</li>
				<li>Finally, no responsive version was available.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This is what the website originally looked like:</p>
		</div>

		<cg-figure src="articles/adult-seo/adult1-old.jpg" caption="The old Design"></cg-figure>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>I then studied our site’s statistics to find out more detailed information. This included a SEO analysis, as well as bounce rate, user flow, and general traffic analysis. This revealed the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bounce rate was first shown as almost 99%. It finally appeared that links were named as id=1, id=2, etc., which prevented proper traffic. More over, this had a bad effect on our SEO, as keywords were present in pages titles, but not in pages URLs.</li>
				<li>Lot of traffic came from Korea/China/Japan. 25% came from Korea, 15% from China, vs 15% from USA. Up to 60% of our total traffic came from Asia.</li>
				<li>There was no caption, alt-text, or description on most media files. This is bad both for SEO <b><i>and</i></b> accessibility.</li>
				<li>Content was focused on “Legacy franchises”, aka franchises spanning the last 15+ years (One Piece, Dragonball, etc). While these series have a lot of fans, analysing concurrent websites showed that those series were far less popular than currently running series (such as Kantai Collection or Sword Art Online at the time of this project).</li>
				<li>On the performance side, thumbnails were poorly generated and had quality issues.</li>
				<li>Also regarding performance, the caching system was inefficient and reduced our SE ranking.</li>
				<li>Finally, 50% of traffic came from mobile devices, making a responsive version even more important.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>METHODS</h2>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>A home link was added to the main menu, as well as to the website banner. The menu was organized around a new content hierarchy, based on user behaviour and most searched content.</p>
		</div>

		<cg-figure src="articles/adult-seo/adult3-menu.jpg" caption="Menu’s new design"></cg-figure>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Tags were moved up to be right below the post title. They were also color-coded to help the users navigate content.</p>
		</div>

		<cg-figure src="articles/adult-seo/adult4-tags.jpg" caption="Tags’ new design"></cg-figure>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>All the URLs were reformatted to include the post title. For example, a post titled “Flower arrangement advice: 7 tips to work faster” would have an URL looking like “/flower-arrangement-advice-7-tips-work-faster”. This is always a dangerous step, as it can be problematic for a website with an already well-established web presence. In our case, we lost some traffic as direct links from other websites didn’t work for a couple of days. However, our search engine ranking increased considerably, making it more than worth it, and we contacted those websites directly to warn them of the modification.</p>

			<p>Instead of showing the whole image directly, each article’s featured image was showned as a teased version, in order to invoke a call to action of clicking on it to see the full image.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Korean, Chinese, and Japanese translation were also added for our most searched keywords and posts.</p>

			<p>Content direction was reoriented so that at least 75% of the content is now about the 3-5 most popular currently running series according to Japanese survey systems such as <a href="http://www.jp.playstation.com/nasne/apps/torne/">Sony’s Torne</a>, or about the best-selling recently released games. The amount of produced fan-made material is also a good indicator of the original material’s popularity.</p>

			<p>A content description was added for most media. This included alt-text for all high-quality pictures as well as caption for post-topping media.</p>

			<p>A “Related posts” section was added, in order to keep users engaged with our content.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Thumbnails were regenerated, and the cache system was improved.</p>

			<p>Finally, the website layout was adjusted to be more responsive. This was the most complicated, and is actually still in progress.</p>

			<p>As a result, the desktop final version looked like this:</p>

		<h2>RESULTS</h2>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Unique visits increased by 90%, while the number of views increased by 260%.</p>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Bounce rate decreased by 22%.</p>
		</div>

		<cg-figure src="articles/adult-seo/adult8-bouncerate.jpg" caption="Bounce rate for the last six months"></cg-figure>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Ad-revenue increased by about 250% (keep in mind that it was a low-revenue website to begin with).</p>

			<p>The site is now on the front page of three major SE for most of our major keywords.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
		
		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>The most important take-away from this project was the importance of mobile design. I know it is something we hear a lot, but seeing numbers is different. Statistics cannot lie:</p>
		</div>

		<cg-figure src="articles/adult-seo/adult10-mobile.jpg" caption="Percentage of mobile/desktop users"></cg-figure>

		<div class="article--text-block">
			<p>Almost half of our users visit the website through mobile, which confirms the importance of a responsive version. Bounce rate decreased even more for mobile/tablets than for desktops, confirming that our responsive design was a good move.</p>

			<p>While I have designed mobile apps before, when it comes to websites I still think desktop first, and mobile comes almost as an afterthought. This project helped me realize how important mobile was, even for websites.</p>

			<p>Another point: heuristics are <b><i>extremely</i></b> useful, and allowed me to start making changes extremely fast.</p>

			<p>Also, SEO is <b><i>hard</i></b>. It is slow, difficult, it takes forever, it is extremely difficult to know what works and what doesn’t, and so on. There are no magic tricks, no “this simple tip increases your SEO by 10%!”, no simple measures; only hard and steady work.</p>

			<p>And finally, this kind of websites gets a LOT of traffic, it is almost ridiculous. Avenue Q was definitely right. This was a great opportunity for me, as I was able to experiment with all this traffic. Since I had complete freedom about what I could do, this was especially interesting, and I could see the results of everything I was doing way more accurately than on a “normal” website. This website, as well as my hobbies and side projects blog for example, average about 10 to 15 views a day – it is almost impossible to know if what I'm doing there has an effect or not.</p>
